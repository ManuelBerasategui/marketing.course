MARKETING 1:
- What is marketing?
CREATING
COMUNICATING
GIVING VALUE --> Price, quality and benefits
- Business and grow strategies

- Marketing Mix: factors that we can control
1. Price
2. Product
3. Promotion (Advertising)
4. Place

1. We control the price, by looking at the price that the customer is willing to pay

5 activites in marketing
1- find a unmet need. Do research (qualitive and quantitive)
	- focus groups (target market)
	- Get their input problem
	- Try to sell them solutions
	- quantitive: quantity of people with the need
	- qualitive: find the niche (unmet need)

2- Identify a development concept: come up with a model

3- Determine a price that the customer is willing to pay

4- find distribution before advertise

5- build awareness

- always have the product available after advertising (have distribution first)

- create interest and desire
- take action

A ttention --> what's going on here?
I nterest --> I want to know more about this!
D esire --> I want it!
A ction --> I buy it

- this model is for customers. 
- the involvment of the purchase is personal. What's expensive for one person is not expensive for another.
- Understand the consumer's behavior. (For this, do research).

- Who is out target market?
- The research helps us getting the best profit. It's not what we think, is what research tells us.
- The only great idea is the one that the customer can give. I don't have great ideas, you don't have great ideas.

- Uncontrolable factors:
	- Environment
	- Economy
	- Politics

- Elastic Market: Is price sensitive. By how much? That's something to look at.
- Anticipate what the demand will be.
- How many units to fit demand?
- The dilema is that you don't want to make to much, but not too less as to do not fit demand.

- How to achieve objectives? Have a plan

3 basic levels in organization:
SBU (Strategic Business Units)
1. Corporate plan
2. Business plan
3. Functional plan

1. Developed by the team that adresses the mission, value and vision of the organization.

- Difference between mission and vision:
	- mission: The bussines that the company is on now. To sell something
	- vision: Where we want to be in the future? To be the number one in something 

- We need to define our business

- You can combine with a partner that has your weaknesses as his strength, and your strengths are his weaknesses.
- Coming together with companies has the advantage of manufacture facilities, employees facilities, etc.
- Too weak companies complaining can be good, but also hard for them to grow up and become bigger.
- Integrating 2 different companies has the problem of desiding the boss. Which of the 2 companies are gonna take desicions.
- Which is the best strategy? To combine?
- Depends on where the expectations are.

- When you achieve your vision, it becomes your mission. And there's where you ask yourself Where to go now? CORPORATIVE PLAN

2. Will make the vision and the mission reality

3. The one that the marketing department will have. The manufacturing department for example.

- The vision has to be something that everybody in the company can understand and agree with. A motivation.

- Who are competitors? Direct and indirect competitors. Why is it?
- Being direct is like milk and juice. Both are taken in the morning. Milk from another company is not a direct competitor.
- Don't forget about them.

BCG model (Boston Consulting group)
- clasify strategic business units.
- portfolio analysis
- Have a snapshot of the elements of our business plan.
	- Growth Rate
	- Market Share
- This is a key. Is the table were you clasify elements if the growth is high or low, and if market share is high on low. Depending on that, you discard some and use anothers.
- This table is portfolio analysis.

MARKETING 2:
- Revising BCG model. Helps us taking desicions
- High grow rate is like 50%
- A product is wrapped in a brand
- Every element has the same generic functionality, but the brand makes the difference between those elements. Like cars.
- If brands didn't exist, advertising wouldn't neither.

- When we advertise, we need to have PROOF POINTS (pillars of support)

- Tagline: Few words that capt the escence of our brand
- Slogan: The theme for our advertising campaign. You change it because people gets tired.

- Different features, like the design, make the product unique.

- If you can explain your product in an ad of 15 seconds, you can print it on people.

- The value doesn't only mean cheap. It can be at high price but high benefits

- Then, we clasify the target market in subcategories. For example, for multipurpose products

- Market share is the percent of total industry sales that a company has. 
- The market share leader is the one that has the most sales in a category.
- Being master brand.
BRAND HEIARCHEY: 
- corporate brand
  master brand
  sub brand
MARKET SEGMENTATION:
- We focus on product type

- Remember: In the example of the protfolio analysis, we are gonna invest more in stars than in dogs.

- You can use the BCG model both as a corporate brand or as a master brand, for clasifying all ayour SBU's, or not all of them istead, maybe, only of the most sold ones.

- 80% of our sells are made by 20% of our products
- SKU Rationalization = Stock Keeping units. Perceptual Mapping

- Purchase intent
- Motivation of purchase

- Evoque set: All the brands that come to mind in a giving category
- Consideration set: One or Two brands that We're gonna purchase
- Find the level of awareness (nivel de consciencia/deseo) and the consideration set. 

- Some markets are inelastic: Not price sensitive
- Some others are Somewhat price sensitive

- Stakeholders: Are people that's interested and impact in an organization and the results of their actions. Could be a supplier, customer, etc.
- Shareholder: Is a person who participates in the capital ivestment in a society, juridic person, etc.

- There has to be a desire and capability.

- First mover advantagers: We make a customer desire our product before the need of problem exists. We create the need.

- Target Market is not the same as Target Public.
- The target public might be more expansive.

- Common objectives/goals:
	- Sales
	- Profit
	- Customer satisfaction
	- Social responsability

MARKETING 3
- Segmentation: Dividing market in submarkets. Make a group of segments. Group specific customers. Maybe, potential customers. Identify segments that are large, reachable. Being reachable is something that the customers are able to view. We need to comunicate with these customers, through advertising for example. If we can't reach them, either from ads or promotions, that's a problem. Identify unmet need --> What their need is? A way of reaching them.
- Market sizing: Quantify the size of the market. Quantify the segments.
- Targeting: Target segments that we identify.
- Positioning: How are we gonna position in the market

- A conceptual map helps us look where is our brand in the market

- Once we reached the potential customers, they will answer to the marketing mix. They're gonna buy. If they look an ad, is gonna give them interest, desire. That'll call them to take action. It's not perfect, not always, not everybody will answer the same way to the mix. Maybe they answer to the product, maybe to the price, etc.

- Â¿How to segment the market?
	- Demographic: we divide the market in segments based on gender, race, religion, education level, income, age, etc. In this groups there are similar things between them. Similar needs, and respond to the marketing mix in a similar way. E.g: they shop online. PLACE (marketing mix) This can help us to gain distribution.
	- Geographic: you can advertise, maybe, for different cultures around the world, or your region, country, etc. Segmentation based on region. You can write a chart, a conceptual chart, segmentating the market. You can also segment based on countries. Quantify the size of the market, the number of population. Which ones are the largest? Which the most expected of growth? The rate of growth. The concentration. What percentage of the market is controlled by 5 companies? Level of rivery. How atractive the market is?
	- Psicographic: Related to lifestyle. Similar lifestyle have similar needs and wants, and they will similarly respond to the marketing mix. Married, Married with kids, empty nestler, single, etc. These are ways of segmenting the market (psicographic market). Life insurance.
	- Beheavioural: usage rate, having users, moderate and light, and product benefit. Segment the market by the benefit that the customer wants.
- There are many ways of segment the market, but those are the most common.

- The way you segment the market maybe very different from the way that others segments the market. That makes you unique.
- Remember that our challenge is to reach our target market.
- Sometimes we have to reach people that's not in our target audience.
- Other times, everyone is your target audience.
- Define your target market.

- Target market is not the same as target audience. Target market can be wider, but target audience is separated. Segmented.
- The better you can optimize the ad the more you will be able to connect and create desire to the customer.
- Communicate to each group with a different advertising and marketing plan. There are gonna be some groups that connect better with some ads than others.
- Remember not to sell to everybody, just like cars, because you will neither target a market nor an audience, and lose customers.

- Again think of who are your direct competitors and who your indirect competitors
- Don't think that doing nothing is the safe desicion. IT'S NOT. 

- Production orientation: we try to sell what we could make 
- Marketing oreientation: we make what we could sell.

- Related diversification: Buy things that are not related to your production. Lack of focus. The more focus, the more productive the company will be.
- Unrelated diversification: Buy things that are related to your production
- retail

-  Look for the brand elasticity. How long can be our brand? Extend brand in different categories
